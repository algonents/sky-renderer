# sky_renderer

**sky_renderer** is a minimalistic 2D rendering engine built in Rust with native bindings to OpenGL.
This version only provides low-level bindings to OpenGL and is not yet production-ready. Future versions will
add support for additional drawing primitives such as lines, shapes, and texts as well as a higher-level rendering API on top of OpenGL.

## üöß Status

This is a (very) early release: this version provides a limited set of bindings to OpenGL and is not yet suitable for production use.
The bindings can nonetheless be used in your own code if you wish to experiment with a minimalistic API to OpenGL. If a specific binding for your use-case is missing, please let me know.

## üêû Issues

You can raise issues directly on [Github](https://github.com/algonents/sky-renderer/issues).

## üîß Installation

### Linux

Make sure you have all dependencies installed on your system (including a C/C++ compiler and CMake):

```shell script
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev
sudo apt install mesa-utils
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
```

You can simply add **sky_renderer** as a dependency to your project. When building your project, cargo will first trigger a C/C++ build (using CMake) of a static library containing the **sky_renderer** ffi bindings to OpenGL. The entire process should be totally transparent to your project.

### Windows

Make sure you are are using release 0.1.7 or later (there was no Windows support for earlier versions). Ensure you have Visual C/C++ and CMake installed on your system.
Also use [vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/overview) to install glfw on your system:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg install glfw3
```

You must also update your system's environment variables:

- Define the `VCPKG_LIB_PATH` environment variable to point to vcpkg's lib folder (this is where glfw3.lib is installed, for example `D:\GitHub\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\lib`)

- Update your system's `PATH` environment variable to point to vcpkg's bin folder (this is where glfw3.dll is installed, for example `D:\GitHub\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\bin`)

### macOS

Ensure you have CMake and a C/C++ compiler installed on your system.
Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install glfw on your system:

```shell script
brew install glfw
brew info glfw
```

Once glfw is installed, the crate's build script will look for the glfw libraries under `/opt/homebrew/lib`

## üìñ Docs

Refer to the **sky_renderer** GitHub [wiki](https://github.com/algonents/sky-renderer/wiki), which will be updated soon.

## üì¶ Examples

Refer to the [examples](https://github.com/algonents/sky-renderer/tree/master/examples) provided in the **sky_renderer** GitHub repository. These will be updated as new features are added.
